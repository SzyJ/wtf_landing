        <p class="normal_text">
            The project architecture is based on the implementation of the Hazel Engine by Yan Chernikov.
            It is constantly evolving as I add new features to the engine when using it in my university projects.

        <h2>The Renderer</h2>
        <p class="normal_text">
            The engine currently only supports OpenGL however the implementation is done in such away that the API is abstracted away from the implementation allowing for easy extention into other APIs in the future. 
        </p>

    <h2>Future Developement</h2>
    <p class="normal_text">
        The primary goal in the process of creating this engine, is to create a tool that is useful for others and myself when creating any real time applications. Alongside being a learning opportunity for myself to investigate what runs the games we play, I plan on implementing an easy interface for adding multiplayer funtionality in a way that I find more intuitive than existing solutions.
