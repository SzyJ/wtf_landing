        <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
        <p class="normal_text">
            Movement was designed in a way to imitate the smoothness and responsiveness of the Super Meat Boy games. Moving left and right happens instantly with no acceleration and holding the jump button, allows for a higher jump. One flip can be done after leaving the ground, however this can be refreshed by touching a wall. Controller is recommended!
        </p>

        <h2>The Gameplay</h2>
        <p class="normal_text">
            The timer is constantly drianing and the only way to refill it, is to kill the ghosts that spawn around you; the longer you can survive, the higher the score. Be careful though! if you get too close to the ghosts, they will attack ending the run and giving your score a harsh penalty. 
        </p>
        <h2>Art</h2>
        <p class="normal_text">
            The art used in the map tiles has been found on the Unity Asset Store but all other art has been drawn and animated by me!
