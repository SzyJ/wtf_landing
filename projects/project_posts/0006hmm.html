        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p class="normal_text">
            Make a directory on your hosting machine, add files to that dir and start the server... Thats it! The contents of the files is the contents of the posts and the name of the file is the title. Designed to be simple.
        </p>
        <h2>How do I integrate it?</h2>
        <p class="normal_text">
            In the repo, you will find an example frontend. All you need to do is copy one of the div's wherever you want the posts to show on your site and copy 2 js files. Dont forget to change the URL to point to your site in the JS file!
